# from-scratch
Scientific and technical concepts implemented cleanly, clearly and with minimal dependency requirements.

This repository is for educational purposes and is meant to demonstrate
implementations of any programmable concept from any domain. Pull
requests are welcome!
- This is language agnostic, so use whatever you'd like. Feel free to
  reimplement an existing example with the tools you prefer.
- The focus is on bare-bones examples that stick reasonably close to the
  underlying mathematical concepts rather than framework abstraction, but
practical implementations are still welcome.
- Linking to other related repos, resources, or including a write up are all also
  welcome.
