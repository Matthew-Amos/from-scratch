# From Scratch
Scientific and technical concepts implemented cleanly, clearly and with minimal dependency requirements.

This repository is for educational purposes and is meant to showcase 
implementations of any programmable concept from any domain. Pull
requests are welcome!
- This is language agnostic, so use whatever you'd like. Feel free to
  reimplement an existing example with the tools you prefer.
- Please try to keep the program focused on a specific task as much as possible (avoid
  excessive setup procedures, generalizing, etc).
- Linking to other related repos, resources, or including write ups are all also
  welcome.
